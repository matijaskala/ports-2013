		Play it slowly is a software to play back audio files at a different
		speed or pitch. It does also allow you to loop over a certain part of
		a file. It's intended to help you learn or transcribe songs. It can also
		play videos thanks to gstreamer. Play it slowly is intended to be used
		on a GNU/Linux system like Ubuntu. If you'd like to have a windows
		version, write a comment.

		Features:
		- Plays every file gstreamer does (mp3, ogg vorbis, midi, even flv!)
		- Can use alsa and jack
		- Change speed and pitch
		- Loop over certain parts
		- Export to wav
