INSTALLATION

You will need to create a database for your TYPO3 installation.
You can use TYPO3's builtin 1-2-3 wizard to do so:

http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/typo3/install/index.php?mode=123&step1

TYPO3 does require a database to work. With the TYPO3 DBAL
extension (database abstraction layer) it is compatible with a
lot of others (e.g. Oracle, Postgres), but the 1-2-3 tool
supports only MySQL.
However it is possible to use a different database system with
DBAL, it is *highly* recommended to only use a different database
system when you are very familiar with TYPO3, since experience
shows you will be very much on your own by doing so.
Even if the DBAL is doing quite a good job within the core of
TYPO3, the software is heavily extensible with thousands of
extensions, developed by independent developers. Chances are good
that these haven't tested their extensions with other database
systems besides MySQL and break the whole site.
So only use TYPO3 with a different database system if you exactly
know what you are doing and how to investigate errors on your
own!

!!!!!!!!!              SECURITY WARNING               !!!!!!!!!!!

TYPO3 has had a history of serious security flaws. Additionally,
the more extensions you add to the application, the higher is the
risk to add further ones.

This might read some kind of startling, but this is the case with
every application out there. The good news is that TYPO3 has a
very vital and highly skilled security task force, which
continuously investigates the core and extensions of TYPO3. They
publish security warnings along with recommended workarounds on
their mailing list, RSS feed, and so on.

TYPO3 is a continuous work in progress (like nearly all current
open source projects) and has to become maintained regularly.
Please only use such kind of software if you are prepared to
maintain it!

Also, be sure to introduce yourself to the security handling in
TYPO3 and subscribe to the typo3-announce mailing list [1] or the
security RSS feed [2][3][4][5] at least!
