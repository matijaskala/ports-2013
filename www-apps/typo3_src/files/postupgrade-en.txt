UPGRADE
                                                            
If you are upgrading from a previous version BACKUP your database
before issuing the following steps!

Once you are done with that, browse to

http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/install/ 

and follow the instructions from the TYPO3 wiki [1] and those on
the screen while executing the upgrade.

!!!!!!!!!              SECURITY WARNING               !!!!!!!!!!!

TYPO3 has had a history of serious security flaws. Additionally,
the more extensions you add to the application, the higher is the
risk to add further ones.

This might read some kind of startling, but this is the case with
every application out there. The good news is that TYPO3 has a
very vital and highly skilled security task force, which
continuously investigates the core and extensions of TYPO3. They
publish security warnings along with recommended workarounds on
their mailing list, RSS feed, and so on.

TYPO3 is a continuous work in progress (like nearly all current
open source projects) and has to become maintained regularly.
Please only use such kind of software if you are prepared to
maintain it!

Also, be sure to introduce yourself to the security handling in
TYPO3 and subscribe to the typo3-announce mailing list [1] or the
security RSS feed [2][3][4][5] at least!
