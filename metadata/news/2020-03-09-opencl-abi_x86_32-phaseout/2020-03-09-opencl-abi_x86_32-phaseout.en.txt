From April 2020 onwards virtual/opencl will no longer provide support
for the 32-bit ABI on either multilib amd64 or native x86 systems. The
reason for this is that most modern OpenCL providers currently available
from Gentoo only support the 64-bit ABI anyway. Therefore, we intend
to initially mask:
 - virtual/opencl in x86 profiles,
 - USE=abi_x86_32 for virtual/opencl in all profiles, and
 - USE=opencl in x86 profiles.
and follow up with removal of multilib support and x86 keywords from
virtual/opencl.

Note that this change will only affect the virtual package, i.e. OpenCL
providers which do support ABI_X86_32 will continue to advertise this
capability. Users of such providers who wish to retain 32-bit OpenCL
support are advised to add virtual/opencl to package.provided; see
portage(5) for details.
