		Steghide is a steganography program that is able to hide data in various
		kinds of image and audio files. The color-frequencies (for image files) or
		sample-frequencies (for audio files) are not changed, thus making the
		embedding resistant against first-order statistical tests. Features of
		steghide include compression and encryption of embedded data, embedding of
		a checksum to verify the integrity of the extracted data, and support for
		JPEG, BMP, WAV, and AU files.
